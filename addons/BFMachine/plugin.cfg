name="BFMachine"
description="BFMachine is a simple BF interpreter for Godot 4.
It is a single file Resource that holds the entire state of the machine inside it,
and a single scene that gives that interpreter a ui, so it can run in editor.
Its also flexible, allowing for you to change settings on the fly, if you so choose.

As this script is fully documented in Godot, you can refer to that for more detailed information on each setting and function."
